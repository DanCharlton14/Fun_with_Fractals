# Fun_with_Fractals
Fractal generator using P5.JS for Hello World Hackathon.

We created a webpage that explores some examples of fractals. The p5.js file contains the code for our fractal animations and if you want to run this code, copy it into the p5.js editor. The Website_code folder contains a html document and the corresponding style css file which you can download onto your computer.

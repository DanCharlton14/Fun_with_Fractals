  <h1> Fractal Geometry </h1>

 <h4> Danny Charlton and Meg Richards </h4>
  <p> Fractals are infinite patterns created through repetition of a process within a feedback loop. They are "self-similar" in that they contain patterns which repeat themselves at different scales. Fractals are found in nature: the branches of trees, the spiral patterns of hurricanes and even in the patterns of blood vessels! Within mathematics, they exist in the form of repeated simple calculations. An equation is solved and the answer is fed back in to the start. So, while the fractals may be very complicated, they stem from humble beginnings.
<br>
<br>

The chaos game is a method used to construct a fractal. The method begins with a polygon and a random starting point, and creates a sequence of points through iteration which often lead to a fractal shape. In particular, a vertex of the polygon is chosen at random and the point at a specified fraction of the distance between these two points is calculated. This point then becomes the starting point for the next iteration, and the process repeats accordingly. For example, the Sierpinski Triangle is formed as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Form a triangle from three points in a plane.</li>
  <li>Randomly select another point in the plane to be the initial point.</li>
  <li>Randomly select any vertex of the triangle.</li>
  <li>Move ("jump") half the distance from the starting point towards this vertex. Plot this new point.</li>
  <li>Repeat from step 3. </li> 
</ol>

<p> Above there are illustrations of some of the more famous fractals generated through Javascript (use the drop down menu to choose). Namely, these are the Sierpinski Triangle, Sierpinski carpet, Vicsek fractal and a pentagonal polyflake generated by the chaos game. Each is generated in a similar way to the process described above, but with slightly different initial points and jump distances (described in the table below). For more information, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game">Wikipedia page</a> on the chaos game is useful.  </p>

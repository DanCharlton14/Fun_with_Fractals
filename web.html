  <h1> Fractal Geometry </h1>

  <p> Fractals are infinite patterns created through repetition of a process within a feedback loop. They are "self-similar" in that they contain patterns which repeat themselves at different scales. Fractals are found in nature: the branches of trees, the spiral patterns of hurricanes and even in the patterns of blood vessels! Within mathematics, they exist in the form of repeated simple calculations. An equation is solved and the answer is fed back in to the start. So, while the fractals may be very complicated, they stem from humble beginnings.
<br>
<br>

The chaos game is a method used to construct a fractal. The method begins with a polygon and a random starting point, and creates a sequence of points through iteration which often lead to a fractal shape. In particular, a vertex of the polygon is chosen at random and the point at a specified fraction of the distance between these two points is calculated. This point then becomes the starting point for the next iteration, and the process repeats accordingly. For example, the Sierpinski Triangle is formed as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Form a triangle from three points in a plane.</li>
  <li>Randomly select another point in the plane to be the initial point.</li>
  <li>Choose a vertex at random.</li>
  <li>Move ("jump") half the distance from the starting point towards this vertex. Plot this new point.</li>
  <li>Repeat from step 3. </li> 
</ol>

<p> Above there are illustrations of some of the more famous fractals generated through JavaScript (use the drop down menu to choose). Let the animations play out so that the patterns can appear! These fractals are the Sierpinski Triangle, Sierpinski carpet, Vicsek fractal and a pentagonal polyflake generated by the chaos game. There is a slider to control the speed of iteration, and for the Sierpinski Triangle you can alter the coordinates of the starting point. Each is generated in a similar way to the process described above, but with slightly different initial points and jump distances (described in the table below). For more information, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game">Wikipedia page</a> on the chaos game is useful.  </p>

<p> As mentioned previously, fractals can resemble natural objects; perhaps the most famous example of this is the Barnsley fern shown above. This fractal requires a more complicated iterative process, and so we obtained the code from <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/golden-ratio.html">the Barnsley fern Wikipedia page</a>. The fern can be mutated into other species of ferns through altering the rules of the iterative process.

These are just a couple of examples of fractals which we find most interesting. For more information on the chaos game, we recommend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs">Numberphile video</a>. Additionally, if you would like to understand the code used to generate such plots, we have linked our github accounts at the top of this page. These contain the code for these particular plots, but the videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">The Coding Train</a> really helped us with our first insight into JavaScript. </p> 



  <h1> Motivation for our project</h1>
<p> We are both Mathematics graduates currently completing Masters degrees at The University of Edinburgh in AI and applied mathematics. For this project, we wanted to explore the topic of fractals since this is an area in which we are both unfamiliar but very interested. We wanted to create a webpage exploring a mathematical concept, so that we could use our pre-existing knowledge as well as learn new skills in web development and JavaScript. Neither of us had used p5.js before, and we wanted to challenge ourselves to expand our coding capabilities.

<br>
<br>
Mainly, we wanted to showcase a mathematical concept which is accessible to people with a variety of backgrounds and abilities. We are interested in encouraging others to explore mathematics and its applications, and thought this was a fun focus for a webpage that could be used for outreach purposes.</p>
